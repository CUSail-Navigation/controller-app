# sailboat_controller

App to control the sailbot sail and rudder using Flutter

## Windows Requirements
Follow the Flutter install guide: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
- I installed everything through VSCode

Optional (For Android phone emulator): 
- Android Studio (I used 2024.3.1): https://developer.android.com/studio/install
- JDK 23: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk23-archive-downloads.html

## Running the App on Windows through VSCode

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the controller-app folder
2. You should have already installed the VSCode extension, if not go to this link: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/mobile.
3. Run ```flutter pub get``` to install all dependencies
4. To run, type ```flutter run```. This will prompt you to chose a device then will display the application (you may need to run ```flutter clean``` beforehand)
